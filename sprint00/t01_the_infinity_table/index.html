                        According to Wong's ancient texts, the Soul Stone could prove to be the greatest threat out of all the Infinity Stones. Gamora
                  knew of the location of the Soul Stone from a map she found to its whereabouts (which she burnt) but kept this a secret from
                  Thanos. Once captured and interrogated by her father, whom tortured Gamora's sister Nebula, he took her to its holding place on
                  Vormir, where Red Skull, the Soul Stone's guardian, told them that it could only be accessed after a personal cost was paid - 
                  namely, the sacrifice of a loved one, to ensure that the owner understood its power.

                        The Time Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a singularity that predated the universe, 
                        representing the element of time. It was contained inside the Eye of Agamotto and placed under the protection of the 
                        Masters of the Mystic Arts. In 2017, Doctor Strange took possession of the Stone and used it to defeat Dormammu.The 
                        following year, during the Infinity War, Doctor Strange relinquished the Stone to Thanos in exchange for sparing Iron 
                        Man's life. Thanos would use the Time Stone during the Battle of Wakanda to resurrect Vision after he was killed by 
                        Wanda Maximoff, in order to acquire the Mind Stone.

                        element of space. Housed within the Tesseract, over the course of history it was wielded by many individuals, including Johann 
                        Schmidt of HYDRA, Mar-Vell of the Kree Empire, the Skrulls, and Loki of Asgard. During the Infinity War, the Tesseract was shattered 
                        by Thanos, who put the Space Stone inside his Infinity Gauntlet. Following the Snap, Thanos destroyed the Space Stone, along with 
                        the other five Infinity Stones.

                        The Mind Stone is one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a singularity that predated the universe, representing 
                        the element of mind. It was previously owned by Thanos inside his Scepter who lent it to Loki for the Chitauri Invasion. 
                        After the Battle of New York, the Scepter was confiscated by HYDRA, whose scientists used it to give extraordinary powers 
                        to the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. After the fall of HYDRA, the Scepter was recovered by the Avengers. It was taken 
                        by Ultron and its blue gem casing was shattered, releasing the stone inside it and placing it on the being that would 
                        become Vision. It remained with Vision until it was forcibly removed by Thanos following the Battle of Wakanda, killing 
                        Vision in the process.

                        element of reality. Liquefied into a dark red fluid called the Aether, the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith intended to use 
                        it to revert the universe to its state of primordial darkness. In 2013, the Aether was absorbed into Jane Foster, triggering the 
                        Second Dark Elf Conflict. Following their defeat, the Aether was taken by the Asgardians and entrusted to the Collector.

                        it was contained within the Orb and hidden for millennia on Morag
                        The Orb containing the Power Stone was coveted by Thanos, who employed the Kree warrior Ronan the 
                        Accuser in 2014 to retrieve it for him. However, before Ronan could acquire the Orb, it was stolen by 
                        Star-Lord, prompting a galaxy-wide hunt that resulted in the Orb being given to the Nova Corps for safe-keeping. 
                        Thanos later retrieved the Power Stone from the Nova Corps in 2018
